# Clientsided Discord PFP Changer
Changes your Discord profile picture on the client (which means that you can use `.gifs` and animated files.)

*Should apply to all avatar elements.*

## Usage
- [Go to the file](https://github.com/GUIDEVELOCI/discord-pfp-changer/blob/main/discordpfpchanger.css)) and copy the code.
- Paste it into Custom CSS or Stylish, Stylus, Amino, or any other alternatives.
- Change the `--pfp` url to your link.
- Copy your Discord ID and replace `your-id` with the text copied and that's it.

**The step above requires Developer Mode to be enabled.**
