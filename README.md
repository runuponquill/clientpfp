# Clientsided Discord PFP Changer
Changes your Discord profile picture on the client (which means that you can use `.gifs` and animated files.)

## Usage
- Go to the file and copy the code.
- Paste it into Custom CSS *(specifically BetterDiscord)* or Stylish, Stylus, Amino, or any other alternatives.
- Change the `--pfp` url to your link and that's it.

*Should apply to all avatar elements.*
